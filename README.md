# flood_prediction

This is a challenge to use computer vision and deep learning models for flood prediction

Note: If you do not have a GPU at hand, you can use https://www.kaggle.com/kernels, https://colab.research.google.com/ for free GPUs or rent a cheap GPU at https://vast.ai/console/create/.


We will use our [Sen1Floods11](https://github.com/cloudtostreet/Sen1Floods11) dataset. 
We will create a local folder `c2s_data/v1.1/data/flood_events/HandLabeled` and download the handlabeled training data (Sentinel-1 512x512 chips, mask labels) there.
